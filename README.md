# React View/Edit Toggle Component

A reusable component that toggles between view and edit modes, perfect for dashboards and admin interfaces.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-view-edit-toggle
```

## Usage

```jsx
import ToggleViewEdit from 'react-view-edit-toggle';
import ProfileView from './components/ProfileView';
import ProfileEdit from './components/ProfileEdit';

const App = () => (
  <ToggleViewEdit
    viewComponent={ProfileView}
    editComponent={ProfileEdit}
  />
);
```

## Props

| Prop           | Type             | Required | Description                                  |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| viewComponent | React component | Yes      | Component to display in view mode           |
| editComponent | React component | Yes      | Component to display in edit mode           |

## Features

- Smooth transition between view and edit modes
- Fully customizable through props
- Zero dependencies
- PropTypes validation
- Responsive design

## Key improvements made:
1. Renamed component to `ToggleViewEdit` for clarity
2. Added PropTypes validation for component props
3. Made component more generic to accept any view/edit components
4. Improved prop naming convention
5. Fixed typo in component name (EdditMoode â†’ EditComponent)
6. Added proper documentation

To use this component, users would pass their custom view and edit components as props:

```jsx
<ToggleViewEdit
  viewComponent={DashboardView}
  editComponent={DashboardEdit}
/>
```

Both passed components will receive a `toggleViewEditMode` prop function to switch modes.
